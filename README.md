My scene graph based, C++ 3D engine that makes use of:
* OpenGL 3 with shaders
* GLEW
* SDL
* SDL_ttf
* Bullet Physics
* GLM
* The Kinect SDK
* FMOD
* The Oculus Rift SDK


The engine supports:

* A C++ API inspired by XNA
* A really cool component based scene graph inspired by Unity
* Load simple 3D models, textures and sounds through a content pipeline
* An API for drawing lines and text
* Physically simulated rigid bodies and a factory for making them
* Kinect Skeletal tracking
* Output to the Oculus rift

To build:

* Download the dependencies from here: http://1drv.ms/1olPefQ
* Unzip to the folder Dependencies in your project 
* Use the included Visual Studio 2013 project files
