	### Ode to the Quaternion
	A quaternion is like a vector, but with a "w"  
	To construct one, use an axis and an angle, that's what we do  
	For rotations it must be normal, or otherwise its pure  
	So we normalise, divide by length, just to be sure  
	To invert a normal quaternion, we negate x, y and z  
	Multiply quaternion, vector, inverse quaternion and it rotates don't you see  
	A rotation of 0 radians is the same as two pi  
	To convert a quaternion to a matrix, we use the API  
	So here's a health to old Hamilton, your inventor it would appear  
	And to imaginary numbers floating in the hypersphere  
	\-	Dr Bryan Duggan
